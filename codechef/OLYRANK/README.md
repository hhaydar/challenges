# Challenge

In Olympics, the countries are ranked by the total number of medals won. You are given six integers G1, S1, B1, and G2, S2, B2, the number of gold, silver and bronze medals won by two different counties respectively. Determine which country is ranked better on the leaderboard. It is guaranteed that there will not be a tie between the two countries.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
